# Gladiator
/* This assignment will be to show your understanding of classes, polymorphism, and searching/sorting. You will need to combine everything you know at this point to help you solve this exercise. Will continue to use javadoc comments before each method. If you are rusty, take a look at the ArrayList assignment before this one in semester 2. */


/*
	You are a gladiator back in the time of Sparta. You have worked your way up through the ranks and the final match now lies before you. The reigning champion is undefeated and no one pictured you could have made it this far already. However, you have a secret. You have a sixth sense that seems to help guide you on perceiving attacks before they happen. Are you able to get this *power* under control enough to win this final match?

	The main goal is to choose either to block your head, body, or legs. If you block successfully, then it allows you to counter-attack for a free attack. There has been an interface and abstract class created that the gladiator class uses. You will need to figure out how to make it work and what you have to do to actually use interfaces and abstract classes. In essence, you will be able to get all of the intelligence gathered over this champion on every round of every fight he has every participated in. In each round, you will be given a previous round that looks like the actions he is starting to perform. If you can make sense of this data (organize it in a way to be used quick enough) then you can perceive his actions before they land. This will be your key to victory!

	Tips - This class will include an abstract class and interface. You will have to create all the correct methods so when they are attempted to be run during the match, you can remain the last one standing. Good Luck!!!
